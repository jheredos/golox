# golox
A Go implementation of the Lox language from Robert Nystrom's book Crafting Interpreters

### Currently supports:
- Control flow (if/else, and, or)
- Variable declaration and scoping
- For and While loops
- Functions

### Coming soon:
- Objects
- Higher-order functions and closures

### To run:
Assuming you have cloned the repo and have Go installed, simply run:
`go build .` to build the interpreter, and then `./golox text.lox` to interpret the test file
